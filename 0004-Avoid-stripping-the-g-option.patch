Subject: [PATCH 4/5] Avoid stripping the -g option

This configure macro strips the -g option from CFLAGS if the
--enable-debug option is not passed. But --enable-debug enables more of
a curl developer debug build (AFAICS), less intended for a distro build
that simply wants to make sure debuginfo is produced and later stripped
and distributed in the separate debuginfo package.

Disable that macro from being called to avoid the -g option stripping.
